        <h2>Researcher | AI & Machine Learning Expert</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Halmstad University, Sweden, working on predictive maintenance projects in collaboration with Volvo. My expertise lies in applying machine learning and AI techniques to optimize industrial operations, enhance safety, and improve predictive maintenance models.
        </p>
        <p>
            Previously, I served as an Associate Professor at Riphah International University and worked as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Ebricks, gaining extensive experience in natural language processing, computer vision, and optimization algorithms. My research has been featured in prestigious journals, including <em>Nature Scientific Reports</em>, covering topics such as heart disease prediction, breast cancer classification, and fake news detection.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, I have contributed to academia and industry by developing scalable AI solutions. I have also collaborated with leading companies such as SquareKnot (Canada), Scenarios, and Paradigm Network (USA), implementing cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning models.
        </p>
        <p>
            My work spans diverse domains, from named entity recognition using BERT and GPT models to seismic activity prediction and procedural content generation for video games. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI research and developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between academia and industry.
