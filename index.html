        <h2>Researcher | AI & Machine Learning Expert</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Halmstad University, Sweden, working on predictive maintenance projects in collaboration with Volvo. My expertise lies in applying machine learning and AI techniques to optimize industrial operations, enhance safety, and improve predictive maintenance models. Currently, I am working on projects that focus on optimizing asset performance and enhancing predictive maintenance for complex equipment such as trucks and pumps. I collaborate within an industry-academia partnership to drive innovation and improve operational efficiency in various industrial sectors.

        <p>
            Previously, I served as an Associate Professor at Riphah International University, Islamabad, where I taught undergraduate and graduate courses in the fields of machine learning, healthcare, and procedural content generation for games. I also conducted research and served as the Head of the Department at the Riphah Institute of Systems Engineering. Additionally, I worked as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Paradigm Networks (USA), where I led the design and development of an NER-based system for policy compliance and worked on security evaluations of AI models. I also contributed to AI-driven projects at Scenarios Limited (Pakistan), focusing on recommendation systems, chatbots, and mobile applications.
